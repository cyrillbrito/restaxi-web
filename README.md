## Running the procject

To start up the project in development mode just run ```npm start```. This will run webpack in watch mode. The files will be generated and saved in the ```dist``` folder.

To building for prod run ```npm run build```. This will generate the minified files and save them to ```dist```.


## Multi-Languages

I was able to have only one template and than using webpack generate a file for each language with the correct labels. This makes developing easiar beacause I don't have to maintain 3 equal files.

By default the website will load the portuguese version of the site, if the user wants to switch the languge he has to do it manually.
